# To-Do App
A user-friendly to-do app built with React and Node.js, allowing users to easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) their tasks.

## Front-end
The front-end of the app is built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components handle the rendering of the to-do items and the input fields for creating new tasks. The app uses state and props to manage the data and user interactions, providing a seamless experience for the users.

## Back-end
The back-end of the app is built with Node.js and it creates an API that the React front-end can communicate with. The API handles the CRUD operations using JavaScript and a database such as MongoDB to store the to-do tasks. This ensures that the tasks are stored securely and can be easily retrieved and manipulated by the users.

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. Once you have those set up, you can clone this repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. After that, you can run npm start to start the development server and begin using the app.

## Conclusion
This app provides an easy way for users to manage their tasks, with the ability to add, view, update, and delete their to-do items. The help of React for UI and Node.js for handling CRUD operations and database management makes it a powerful tool for staying organized and on top of your tasks.
